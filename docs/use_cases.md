# Reaver Language Use Cases

The Reaver programming language, with its current set of features, is primarily designed for specific educational and foundational programming scenarios. It is not intended for general-purpose application development but serves as an excellent tool for understanding core concepts.

## Primary Use Cases

1.  **Educational Tool for Compiler Design and Programming Fundamentals**:
    *   **Learning Compiler Construction**: Reaver's most significant use case is as a hands-on learning platform for compiler design. Its simple structure allows students and enthusiasts to grasp the entire compilation pipeline:
        *   **Lexical Analysis (Lexing)**: How source code is broken into tokens.
        *   **Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)**: How tokens are structured into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
        *   **Semantic Analysis**: How the AST is checked for logical consistency and errors (e.g., undeclared variables).
        *   **Code Generation**: How the AST is translated into low-level assembly instructions.
        *   **Linking**: How compiled code is combined with runtime libraries to form an executable.
    *   **Understanding Programming Concepts**: Its minimalist syntax helps beginners focus on fundamental programming constructs like variables, arithmetic operations, conditional logic (`if`/`else`), and iterative control flow (`while` loops) without the complexities of advanced language features.

2.  **Simple Scripting and Fixed Calculations**:
    *   Reaver can be used for very basic, self-contained computational tasks where inputs are hardcoded or known beforehand.
    *   Examples include:
        *   Performing simple arithmetic calculations (e.g., `examples/math.rv`, `examples/calculator.rv`).
        *   Implementing basic algorithms like factorial calculation (`examples/factorial.rv`) or summing a series of numbers (`examples/sum_n.rv`).
        *   Demonstrating fundamental logic (e.g., `examples/logic_gates.rv`, `examples/even_odd.rv`).

3.  **Exploring Language Design and Turing Completeness**:
    *   For those interested in theoretical computer science, Reaver serves as a practical example of a Turing-complete language with a minimal instruction set. It demonstrates that even with very few commands, any computable function can theoretically be implemented.
    *   It can be a sandbox for experimenting with new, simple language features or compiler optimizations in a highly controlled environment.

## What Reaver is NOT Designed For (Current Limitations)

It's important to understand what Reaver is *not* currently suited for, due to its intentional simplicity:

*   **General-Purpose Application Development**: Lacks essential features for real-world applications, such as user input, complex data types (strings, arrays, objects), functions, modules, file I/O, and extensive standard libraries.
*   **High-Performance Computing**: While it compiles to native code, its current design does not include advanced optimizations or features for demanding computational tasks.
*   **Interactive Programs**: Without user input capabilities, programs are limited to processing predefined data.
*   **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) or Web Development**: Reaver has no built-in support or libraries for these domains.

In summary, Reaver is a powerful educational tool for understanding the core mechanics of programming languages and compilers, and for demonstrating simple computational logic.
