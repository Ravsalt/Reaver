# Factorial Example

# This program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer N.
# N! = N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1
# 0! = 1

N = 5 # Change N to calculate factorial for a different number

rp "Calculating factorial of:"
rp N

# Handle base case for 0!
if N < 1 {
    result = 1
} else {
    result = 1
    counter = 1
    while counter < N + 1 {
        result = result * counter
        counter = counter + 1
    }
}
